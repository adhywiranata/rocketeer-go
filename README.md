> AWS Lambda Serverless Helpers and Libraries for Golang Runtime

## Why ?

We're building Rocketeer to solve common serverless problem:

- Duplicate patterns implemented for each functions, which often leads to different coding styles, naming conventions, and tipical duplicate codes
- Each handlers need to implement middleware layers for authentication, api keys, error handling, etc
